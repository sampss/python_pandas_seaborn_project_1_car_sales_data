    "### **Data Project Rubric:**  **Data Analysis with Python (Pandas & Matplotlib)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1\\. Project Overview** \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Objective**: Students should define the project's goal or main question.   \n",
    "  * Example: *Analyze which days of the week have the highest sales.*  \n",
    "* **Data Source**: Describe where the data comes from and how it might answer the question.  \n",
    "  * Example: This data source comes from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hhs/health-insurance\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2\\. Data Collection and Loading** \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Load Data**: Use Pandas to load a dataset (CSV, Excel, or database).  \n",
    "* **Initial Check**: Display the first few rows and basic information about the dataset, noting column names, types, and missing values.  \n",
    "* **Selection Options**:  \n",
    "  * Choose a dataset you find interesting (Video game sales, Sports stats, Carbon emissions, etc.).  \n",
    "  * Choose which columns or data to focus on and drop the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3\\. Data Cleaning and Preparation** \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Handle Missing Values**: Choose how to handle missing values (drop, fill, or leave as is).  \n",
    "  * Explain why you did this drop, fill, etc.   \n",
    "* **Data Type Adjustments**: Convert columns to appropriate types (e.g., dates to datetime).  \n",
    "* **Feature Engineering**: Create at least one new feature from existing data.  \n",
    "  * Example: extracting the month from a date  \n",
    "  * Calculate the percentage  \n",
    "  * Combine first and last name columns into a full name column \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4\\. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Descriptive Statistics**: Provide summary statistics (mean, median, min, max) for numerical columns.  \n",
    "* **Data Visualizations**:  \n",
    "  * **Required**: One visualization (e.g., line plot) if time-series data is relevant.  \n",
    "  * **Optional**: Additional visuals like bar charts for comparisons, histograms for distributions, or scatter plots for relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5\\. Analysis and Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Findings**: Summarize any patterns observed and address the main project question.  \n",
    "* **Supporting Data**: Reference specific statistics or plot features to back up findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6\\. Conclusion and Recommendations (10 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Summarize**: Present the main conclusions drawn from the analysis.  \n",
    "* **Recommendations**: Based on findings, suggest actions or further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Optional Advanced Section (Bonus)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Advanced EDA**: Use pair plots or correlation matrices to explore relationships.  \n",
    "* **Dashboards**: Create a simple dashboard with Matplotlib or extend to Dash/Streamlit.\n",
